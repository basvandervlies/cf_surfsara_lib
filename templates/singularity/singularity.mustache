# ALLOW SETUID: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid binary for launching singularity?  
# The majority of features require this to be set to yes, but newer Fedora and  
# Ubuntu kernels can provide limited functionality in unprivileged mode.  
allow setuid = {{{vars.scl.singularity.allow_setuid}}}
  
  
# ALLOW PID NS: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# Should we allow users to request the PID namespace?  
allow pid ns = {{{vars.scl.singularity.allow_pid_ns}}}
  
  
# ENABLE OVERLAY: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# Enabling this option will make it possible to specify bind paths to locations  
# that do not currently exist within the container. Some limitations still exist  
# when running in completely non-privileged mode. (note: this option is only  
# supported on hosts that support overlay file systems).  
# note: currently disabled because RHEL7 kernel crashes with it... :(  
enable overlay = {{{vars.scl.singularity.enable_overlay}}}
  
  
# CONFIG PASSWD: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# If /etc/passwd exists within the container, this will automatically append  
# an entry for the calling user.

# DEFAULT: yes  
# If /etc/group exists within the container, this will automatically append  
# an entry for the calling user.

# CONFIG RESOLV_CONF: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes

# /etc/resolv.conf.

# MOUNT DEV: [yes/no/minimal]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# Shoudl we automatically bind mount /dev within the container? If you select  
# minimal, and if overlay is enabled, then Singularity will attempt to create  
# the following devices inside the container: null, zero, random, urandom  
# note: This requires 'enable overlay = yes'  
mount dev = {{{vars.scl.singularity.mount_dev}}}
  
# MOUNT HOME: [BOOL]  
# DEFAULT: yes  
# Should we automatically determine the calling user's home directory and  
# attempt to mount it's base path into the container? If the --contain option  
# is used, the home directory will be created within the session directory or  
# can be overridden with the SINGULARITY_HOME or SINGULARITY_WORKDIR  
# environment variables (or their corresponding command line options).  
mount home = {{{vars.scl.singularity.mount_home}}}

# MOUNT TMP: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we automatically bind mount /tmp and /var/tmp into the container? If
# the --contain option is used, both tmp locations will be created in the
# session directory or can be specified via the  SINGULARITY_WORKDIR
# environment variable (or the --workingdir command line option).

# MOUNT HOSTFS: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: no
# Probe for all mounted file systems that are mounted on the host, and bind
# those into the container?
mount hostfs = {{{vars.scl.singularity.mount_hostfs}}}


# BIND PATH: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# Define a list of files/directories that should be made available from within
# the container. The file or directory must exist within the container on
# which to attach to. you can specify a different source and destination
# path (respectively) with a colon; otherwise source and dest are the same.

# USER BIND CONTROL: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Allow users to influence and/or define bind points at runtime? This will allow
# users to specify bind points, scratch and tmp locations. (note: User bind
# control is only allowed if the host also supports PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)
user bind control = {{{vars.scl.singularity.user_bind_control}}}


# MOUNT SLAVE: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we automatically propagate file-system changes from the host?
# This should be set to 'yes' when autofs mounts in the system should
# show up in the container.

# CONTAINER DIR: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: /var/singularity/mnt
# This path specifies the location to use for mounting the container, overlays
# and other necessary file systems for the container. Note, this location
# absolutely must be local on this host.

# SESSIONDIR PREFIX: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: /tmp/.singularity-session-
# This specifies the prefix for the session directory. Appended to this string
# is an identification string unique to each user and container. Note, this
# location absolutely must be local on this host. If the default location of
# /tmp/ does not work for your system, /var/singularity/sessions maybe a
# better option.
